# Devasc_Skills
Skills lab

1. Github
Preparation :
mkdir Devasc_Skills on devasc-machine
make a new repo on github
change the main branch on github to master
include a .gitignore and a README.md
invite teacher (optional)
Implementation :
git remote add origin https://github.com/jholsteyn/Devasc_skills.git
git pull origin master (to sync local and remote for readme and .gitignore)
Troubleshooting :
had a typo in my repo name with git remote add
git remote rm origin
git remote add origin again
Verification :
Check with rit config --list and git remote -v
ll to see if .gitignore and a README.md were locally present.
